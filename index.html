                Step back in time and experience the legendary island that

                This memorable tour includes: 45 minute audio presentation 
                "Doing Time: The Alcatraz Cellhouse Tour," featuring actual correctional officers and 
                prisoners who lived and worked on the Island; orientation video by Discovery Channel; 
                ranger and docent tours; historic gardens and abundant wildlife.</p>
